**AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Signal Management System ðŸš¦**

This project leverages AI and machine learning to revolutionize urban traffic management. By integrating a **Random Forest Classifier**, the system dynamically optimizes green light allocation based on real-time data, including:

â€¢	Traffic flow and queue lengths

â€¢	Pedestrian movement

â€¢	Weather conditions

â€¢	Emergency vehicle priorities



**Key Features**

â€¢	**Dynamic Signal Adjustment**: Reduces congestion and average waiting times.

â€¢	**Emergency Vehicle Prioritization**: Ensures seamless passage for critical scenarios.

â€¢	**Weather Adaptation**: Adjusts signal timing for rainy or snowy conditions.

â€¢	**Data-Driven Insights**: Performance metrics like total cars cleared and average waiting times.



**Methodology**

â€¢	Uses synthetic traffic datasets with pre-processed features such as normalized traffic volumes and weather conditions.

â€¢	Implements a modular architecture with classes for managing traffic signals, sensors, and real-time decision-making.

# AI in Traffic Management
The objective of this code is to create a machine learning-based smart traffic management system that predicts the optimal green light direction at intersections based on traffic flow data and weather conditions. The system is built using a Random Forest Classifier and simulates traffic and weather data to make real-time decisions for efficient traffic flow.
